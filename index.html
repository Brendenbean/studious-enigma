    <p class ="paraContent">What I want to preserve is the venues of blues music because of its rich culture and the slow soothing feeling you get listening to it while sitting and enjoying food. This big part of history brought together countless communities which came together and danced throughout the night and day.</p>

    <p class="yeet">The solution I have to keep this memory alive is a venue for all ages. So instead of in the past you would mostly drink and dance at this venue you can learn the history of blues music while getting that same joy from what people felt back in the day. Anyone can learn how to play instruments used to create blues music jamming to good old blues with foods from back in the days.</p>
